# WIX1003 - Traffic Light Control System
This repository contains the lab assignment project for WIX1003 – Computer Systems and Organization. This mini-project is a collaborative effort by our student group to design and develop a prototype computer system that controls traffic lights at a cross-junction.

## Objectives
The main goals of this assignment are to:
- Stimulate creativity and innovation among students.
- Deepen understanding of computer systems and real-world applications.
- Apply theoretical knowledge in designing microprocessor-based control systems.

## Background & Requirements
### Project Task
Our team is tasked with building a working demo of a traffic light control system for a cross-junction. The system must be capable of managing traffic flow in all directions, ensuring safe and fair passage for all vehicles.

### Minimal Requirements
- The system must be built using a microprocessor or microcontroller.
- Control of tri-color traffic lights (Green, Yellow, Red) at each junction arm is required.
- All directions should have equal opportunity to move and cross the junction safely.

### Light Indicators
- Green: Go
- Yellow: Prepare to stop
- Red: Stop and wait

## Suggested Additional Feature
To enhance the user experience, implement a countdown timer display that shows the remaining time before the light changes. This helps drivers anticipate movement and improve safety.

## Submission Requirements
The following materials must be included in this repository:
- Component Connection Diagram (schematic or image)
- Complete Source Code
- System Operation Explanation
- Design Considerations & Limitations

## Week 14 Presentation Guidelines
During the final presentation, the group must demonstrate and explain the system by covering:
- System Structure – components and architecture
- Design Considerations & Limitations
- System Operation Overview
- Live Demo – real-time demonstration of the working prototype

## How to Use This Repository
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate through the folders to explore the code and documentation.
- Use the provided diagrams and explanations to understand system design and functionality.
